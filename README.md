# Image Downscaling & Super-Resolution based on Once-for-All

This repository contains image downscaling & super-resolution project code based on the paper ["Once-for-All: Train One Network and Specialize it for Efficient Deployment"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09791) (ICLR 2020).

The objective of this proejct
* Find the best image downscaling & super-resolution neural network architecture on mobile devices.
* Find the best
